<h3>Functionality:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When the user scrolls the header stays up.</li>
  <li>The most important part of the page are the filters. 
The initial filtration is ALL, ie all cards are selected.</li>
  <li>It has filters by: Category, Time Frame and Group Size.</li>
  <li>If 1 field is marked, only the marked cards are filtered.</li>
  <li>The filters are interdependent.</li>
  <li>When you press the same button a second time, it will be deselected.</li>
  <li>If we have selected 3 filters from 3 different categories and if not there is that game we will show that there is no such game.</li>
  <li>When the visitor clicks on one of the cards, it will display the single page for the game itself with game information.</li>
  <li>When you press the register / login button everything will be brought to the form page.</li>
  <li>The website is responsive to all devices and screen resolutions.</li>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
